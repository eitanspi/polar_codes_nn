# **Polar Code Analysis with Neural Networks**

This repository provides scripts and data for analyzing polar codes, comparing classical and neural network-based decoding methods to enhance performance, especially in unknown or memory channels.

## **Overview**
Polar codes are error-correcting codes capable of achieving Shannon capacity with successive cancellation (SC) decoding. This project investigates performance enhancements by integrating neural network approaches, particularly for channels with unknown characteristics.

## **Project Structure**

### Classic Polar Coding
- **`classic_polar_coding.py`** – Implements the classic polar coding algorithm, including:
  - Random binary message generation
  - Frozen bit insertion
  - Polar encoding
  - BPSK modulation
  - AWGN channel simulation
  - Channel embedding (LLR computation)
  - Check-node and bit-node operations
  - Successive Cancellation (SC) decoding given frozen indices
  - SC decoding with a genie for analysis purposes

### Frozen Bit Selection
- **`best_indices_selection.py`** – Determines optimal frozen bit positions for polar codes using Monte Carlo simulations across AWGN, BEC, and BSC channels. Outputs a JSON file ranking indices from least reliable to most reliable per block length.
- **`frozen_bits.json`** – Contains precomputed sets of frozen bits for various block lengths, generated by `best_indices_selection.py`.

### Analysis and Performance Evaluation
- **`polar_code_analysis.py`** – Computes and visualizes Bit Error Rate (BER) as a function of block length.
  - Inputs: Code rate (information bits vs. frozen bits), channel type (AWGN, BEC, BSC), channel parameters (e.g., noise level), and a JSON file of ranked indices.
  - Outputs: BER statistics and corresponding plots.

### Neural Network-Based Decoding
- **`train_nn_embedding.py`** – Trains a neural network (using the MINE framework) to estimate mutual information over an AWGN channel with BPSK modulation. The trained model is saved for inference.
- **`nn_embedding.py`** – Loads the trained MINE neural network model and computes Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) used for polar decoding.
- **`test_nn_embedding.py`** – Evaluates the performance and accuracy of the trained neural network model.
- **`sc_nn_embedding.py`** – Implements Successive Cancellation decoding combined with neural network embeddings.

### Comparative Analysis
- **`nn_vs_classic_analysis.py`** – Compares the decoding performance of neural network-based methods against classical polar decoding methods, providing performance metrics and visual comparisons.
